# AWS Cognito

Give users an identity so that they can interact with our application.

## Cognito User Pools:
- Sign in functionality for app users.
- Integrate with API gateway and application load balancer.
- Create a serverless database of user for your web & mobile apps
- Simple login: Username password combination
- Password reset
- Email & Phone number verification
- Multi-factor authentication
- Federated Identities: users from Facebook, Google, SAML
- Feature: block users if their credentials are compromised elseware
- Login sends back a JSON Web Token (JWT)

## Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity):
- Provide AWS credentials to users so they can access AWS resources directly.
- Integrate with Cognito User Pools as an identity provider.

### Some useful terms

*Callback URL*- where to redirect user once he is authenticated.
*Sign out URL*- where to redirect after signout.
Authorization code grants.
Allowed OAuth Flows and Implicit grant.
*Hosted-ui* provides a ready to use ui interface for authentication actions. For example login form, signup form, forget password feature is available to use and user is redirected to pages based on it.

### Notes
- There is also options to customize the built-in Sign-in and Sign-up webpages aka hosted-ui.

That's all folks! Let me know your feedback/suggestions in the comments.
