  Technical architects must be using UML diagrams to effectively propose and document their solutions. Because UML is the standard which can communicate precisely and accurately across technical and business background people.

# Introduction

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard pictorial language for specifying, visualizing, contructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems.

### History

Multiple modellling techniques without a common standard led to confusing documents of software systems.
Hence, one group called Object Management Group (OMG) proposed a draft of UML 1.0 spec in 1997.

### Communication

Different roles like Product Owner, Business Analyst, Architect, Operations, Quality Assurance, Developer. All need to communicate clearly and make sure everyone understands the same meaning. Terms use by business people and by technical people are bit different.

Hence, there was a need of common Language of communication
Moreover, people are working remotely and we need to make sure that those who are not in the meeting are also communicated exactly same thing.

### Tools

Informal tools like whiteboard and camera or some formal tools that can generate the required figures. I use [draw.io](https://draw.io) to quickly create basic diagrams.

# Basics

- Types of models
- Basic Building Blocks
- Common Extensions
- Key Considerations

## Structural Modelling

- Things
    - Physical
    - Conceptual
- Static Parts
- Nouns
- Diagrams
    - Class
    - Component
    - Package
    - Deployment

## Behavioral Modeling
It represents the interaction between the structural diagrams.

- Functionality
    - Process
    - Interactions
- Dynamic Parts
- Verbs
- Diagrams
    - Use Case
    - Sequence
    - State
    - Activity

## Basic Building Blocks

- Things
    - Class
    - Use Case
    - Component
    - Node
- Messages, States, and Actions
- Relationships
    - Association
    - Generalization
    - Implementation
    - Dependency

### Basic Notations

1. Class  

2. Interface

3. Collaboration

4. Use Case

5. Actor

6. Initial State  

7. Final state

8. Relationships

## Common Extensions

- Annotations/ Notes
- Streotype
- Iconic Streotype

## Key Considerations

- Keep diagram clean
    - Readable
        Number of lines crossing each other should be minimum.
    - Focused
        What is needed must be there and nothing extra.
    - Precise
        Make sure everyone understand the same meaning.
- Goals
    - Visualize
    - Specify
    - Document
- Keep the audience in mind

# Structural Modelling

Blueprint of the system.

- Class Diagram  
- Component Diagram  
- Package Diagram  
- Deployment Diagram  
   
## Class Diagram

Identifies the vocabulary and relationships.

## Component Diagram

- Identify Interfaces
- Define replaceable parts  

Model the physical aspects of the system. Visualize how the components are organized in a system. It does not describes the functionality, just the components used to make those functionalities.

*Eg: Modelling a database schema.*

## Deployment Diagrams

Map components to physical systems.
Visualize hardware and network dependencies of a system, where those components are deployed. Represented using nodes which are physical hardware used to deploy the app.
Big picture of how the system is functioning.

*Eg: Visualize the hardware topology of a system.*

*ATM Deployment diagram example*

# Behavioral Modelling
How the components interact with each other.
What our system does and how.
Interaction is basically a message exchange between two UML components.

- Use Case Diagrams
- Sequence Diagram
- State Diagram
- Activity Diagram

## Use Case Diagram
Represents a particular functionality of a system using actors, and their relationships. They convey details about what is happening but doesn't say anything about how it is happening.

*Eg: Requirement analysis of a user story or visualization of System Interations.*

*ATM Use Case diagram example*
![ATM Use Case diagram](/media/atm-use-case-diagram.png 'ATM Use Case diagram')

## Sequence Diagrams
Visualize the sequence of message flow in a system to perform a specific functionality. It represents the dynamic aspect of the system. It's like a snapshot of the running system at a particular moment.

*Eg: sequentially ordered messages between objects.*

*ATM transaction sequence diagram example*
![ATM transaction sequence diagram](/media/atm-transaction-sequence-diagram.png 'ATM transaction sequence diagram')

## State Diagram
Real-time system is expected to be reacted by some kind of internal/external events.  
State diagrams represents the event driven state change of a system during it's lifetime.

*Eg: Modelling states of an object in a system and the events causing this state transitions.*

*ATM transaction state diagram example*
![ATM transaction state diagram](/media/atm-transaction-state-diagram.png 'ATM transaction state diagram')

## Activity Diagram
It is simply a flowchart describing the flow of control in a system. The flow can be sequential, concurrent (fork and join), or branched (decisional). It gives an idea of how the system will work when executed.

It consists of Actions and Activities. Where action is logically a single step/operation which cannot be broken down. While Activities can be decomposed into smaller activities/actions.

*Eg: Modeling workflow by using activities.*

*ATM activity diagram example*

That's all we need to know about UML. Now we are ready to pick any tool and start drawing the diagrams.  
Feel free to share your feedback and the models which you are creating.
