  It's mid of march and still snow is all over the trek route. Making summit climb difficult specially without professional gears and logistics. Anyway, let's see what are the challenges...

It's a long weekend due to holi festival and pleasing wheather in mid of march is tempting to go for another trip to the mountains before summer arrives.

Me and my friend Rahul decided to go for Churdhar trek.

With the height of 12k feet, Churdhar is the highest peak in outer Himalayan range.

Initial trail thorugh grassy and rocky path is quite steep. Then, it's moderate gradients through dense Deodhar forest. Finally, last part is again rocky and pretty steep.

As soon as the middle part of forest area ends. We get to see outstanding views.

### Getting There
Nohradhar is the base camp for Churdhar trek. It's 5-6 hours drive from Chandigarh.
Road was in average condition. Traffic was much less then expectation. Beautiful views of the valley area makes it pleasant driving and I prefer taking many breaks along the way to see those views.

### Planning
We left around 13:00 from Chandigarh. Our target was to reach Nohradhar by the evening, stay there for the night and then start our trek in the morning.

Rahul had been to Churdhar before and based on his experiences our plan was to reach summit by late afternoon and then stay there in one of cottages near the temple.

### Let's go
